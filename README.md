# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Internationalization (i18n)

This app uses [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) and [expo-localization](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/localization/) for internationalization support. Translation files are located in the `locales/` directory at the project root.

**Supported languages:**
- English (en)
- Mandarin Chinese (zh)

To add or update translations, edit the corresponding JSON file in `locales/`. To add a new language, create a new JSON file and update the i18n configuration.
